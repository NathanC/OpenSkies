This was my first real haskell project. It's a 2d space game, using GTK.

Long term goals is for this to be a polished game that's enjoyable to play, 
and possibly to migrate the game over to use FRP.

My license for this is currently "All rights reserved", simply because it's
my first haskell game and I want to develop it just by myself initially, but
at some point I'll probably make it open-source.
